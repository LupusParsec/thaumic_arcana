THINGS TO FIX

* Some recipes in Thaumonomicon are not being shown properly in the following researches;
  - Bestialchemy
  - Slime Meat

* Fix the wrong required item in the 2/3 stage in Creature Enchant Modification research;
  - The "Enchantment Modifier Powder" with *Normal* effects is shown, but the non-effect powder is the right required item to be consumed (the black one)

* Fix a bug with Biomancy's draws in the Research Table where the required items to be consumed are NOT getting consumed at all;

* Add recipes to a research in Thaumonomicon (maybe creating a new one) for;
  - Incubated Egg
  - Nutritious Mix
  - Organic Curiosity
  - Vaporous Curiosity
  - Infused Curiosity
  - Animated Curiosity
  - Aura Wood Sapling
  - Research Results
  - All the Infused Slime Balls

* Add some missing items to Thaumonomicon;

* (Maybe) Change the texture for some icon entries in Thaumonomicon;
  - Enchantment Effect > less thin
  - Material Studies: Hay > change to hay bayle
  - Creature Enchant Modifier: Negation > wrong powder

* Fix grammar in Thaumonomicon entries;
  - Some small mistakes; - ALMOST DONE (I think...)

  - thaumic_arcana.disable_creature_enchants.name=Disempowerment

  - Mind Inhibitor - DONE (provisory texture)
  - Aura Leaves - DONE (provisory texture)
